## üì¶ Technologies

- [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
- [AWS Route53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/)

## ‚≠ê How It's Built

This was built from scratch with React and TailwindCSS, which includes a light/dark theme toggle. Using MDX content, static pages are generated with Gatsby and GraphQL. Automatically deploys to netlify, with routing on AWS Route53 for the domain.

Using Figma, I created the designs to follow and basic component layout of the site:
